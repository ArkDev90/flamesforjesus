	<pre style="font-size:150%">
	On the day following the Pilgrimage to Kevelaer, Kuya Mon conducted a short, basic training on how to pray for healing. This was attended by a number of committed members of the MSN, plus some more interested friends/brothers and sisters in the faith. The practicum came after a short talk/exhortation on the subject. Under Kuya Mon's guidance (with me assisting), the attendees themselves applied what they have learned by praying over each other.  God's wonderful touch was again experienced. Not only were a number get healed, but some also received the boldness from the Spirit to operate the healing gift they felt like they already have with them in the past.
