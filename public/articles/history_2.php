	<pre style="font-size:150%">With God leading the way, the PNB Christian Community grew and spread out to offices in Sta. Cruz, Binondo and the Pier Area. Prayer meetings were held at Solid Bank, AIC Center, Security Bank and Red Cross.

Members of these prayer groups would go to the PNB Auditorium for the noontime preaching of God's Word. They also gathered together for fellowship and prayer meetings at the Big 20 Restaurant across the PNB Building in Escolta. Prayer groups were also formed at the Bureau of Plant Industry, PNB Buendia Branch  and NEDA Quezon City as some of the Community members were either assigned to other offices or evangelized their relatives or friends who later desired to have their own prayer groups in their respective offices.

Aside from conducting prayer meetings in these offices and the daily noontime preaching of God's Word, the PNB Christian
Community held weekly sharing, training sessions, care groups and Bible Study groups for spiritual growth, to strengthen unity among members, to expand its membership, to raise more workers and prayer group leaders and to equip the members with spiritual gifts and talents needed for the mission work of theCommunity.

They also held monthly Overnight  Prayer and Fasting at the Greenhills residence of Sis. Cielo Macapagal Salgado to praise and worship the Lord and to seek His message and guidance for the Community.The PNB Christian Community was also blessed to have a music ministry to help in its evangelizing and healing crusades.

In the early eighties, the PNB Christian Community held its first Valentine concert for families and friends entitled "TheSweet Sounds for Jesus" at  the Kowloon Restaurant.  A second Valentine concert  was held the following year at the Hotel Mirador. Because of  the resounding success of these concerts in fostering  fellowship among the various prayer groups and their families, the Valentine concert became an annual activity of the Community. Moreover, the next batch of choir singers adapted the name "Sweet Sounds for Jesus Choir" from the theme of the first Valentine concert.

In 1983, the Community embarked on its first provincial outreach mission.Trusting in the faithfulness of the Lord to lead the way and to provide for their needs,the Community boldly went to Lingayen, Pangasinan to conduct evangelistic and healing crusades. Many people were touched by the songs, preaching, and sharing. There were miracle healings and the spiritual gifts of the Community members were activated and released.
