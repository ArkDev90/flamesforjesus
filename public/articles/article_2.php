	<b><h1 style="font-size:180%" class="section-title">An Evening of Healing with CARA NOVA, a Belgian Catholic Charismatic Community in Ghent (23 May 2018)</h2></b>
	<pre style="font-size:150%">
	Quickened by the Holy Spirit after the Sunday Healing Activity at the Sint Stefanus Church, Dirk Claeys, a committed member of MSN Community, testified to his friends in CARA NOVA about what transpired that Sunday at the Sint Stefanus church.  He is also an attendee to the prayer meetings of said Belgian group. He is playing the guitar during their prayer meetings whenever he is present. 

He strongly proposed to the group to invite Kuya Mon to deliver a talk before the group regarding Healing – the same activity Kuya Mon conducted for MSN community.  Despite the short notice, and considering Kuya Mon's brief stay in Belgium, the leaders of the community got eventually convinced by Dirk. And so on a Wednesday night (during CARA NOVA's supposedly regular prayer gathering),   Kuya Mon spoke and conducted as well a healing activity with CARA NOVA. We learned too then that there were also some leaders/active members of other Belgian charismatic communities who came that “special night” upon invitation of the leaders of CARA NOVA. 

Since everyone in the group speaks only Dutch (well a few ones speak little English too), one of the leaders in the community acted as the translator. Despite the language barrier (because some statements were not exactly translated as they should be), God's powerful presence was experienced that night. Many of those who attended, including nuns, testified of being healed! Many others received the affirmation from the Holy Spirit, that they received the gift of healing – as they were still feeling the Lord's presence: shaking and shivering even after the gathering that night already (supposedly) ended.
