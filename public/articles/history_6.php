	<pre style="font-size:150%">With the rapid expansion of its youth ministry, FOFJ started to conduct in the late nineties, summer youth camps/conventions
for YFJ members from the different campus, chapters and local groups. Two of  the summer youth camps/conventions were held in Los Ba√±os, Laguna. The youth conventions had different themes for each year but the objective remained the same, i.e., to make the YFJ  participant  a better person with a dream, a goal and a purpose in life knowing that the Almighty God loves him, that God has a perfect plan for him and is able to bring these plans to fulfillment. Participants were also trained to become good members, future youth leaders and workers of the YFJ.

	In 1999, the FOFJ embarked on a new summer mission work among Aetas. Sis. Cielo Macapagal Salgado who was then the Vice Governor of Pampanga paved the way for 26 young men and women, mostly college students and graduates from PUP and the
City College of Manila and several youngprofessionals under the supervision of five FOFJ Elders and adult workers to live for five weeks in the Aeta resettlement communities of Villa Maria and Inararo in Porac, Pampanga which were under the pastoral care of Fr.Louie Ortner, SVD. They conducted the first FOFJ Summer Literacy Program for 60 Aeta preschool and elementary students.They taught the preschoolers basic reading, writing and hygiene while the grade school students were given supplementary teaching.The Aeta children were also catechized and evangelized for Jesus. One notable projectof the group was the book for preschoolers entitled "ABAKADA para sa Aeta" which featured illustrations of Aeta children and situations in their communities. The FOFJ published 100 copies of this book to help in the literacy program.

	Because of the positive effects of the literacy program in providing supplementary teaching to the Aeta children, as well as providing a hands-on immersion for FOFJ mission workers, the FOFJ continued to undertake this program for four more years.
