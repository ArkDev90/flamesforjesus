	<pre style="font-size:150%">
	Each last Sunday of the month, MSN community holds Holy Mass celebrations. Therefore on May 27, just 2 days prior to Kuya Mon's departure for the Philippines, the Sto. Niño Mass was held. In coordination with the leaders of the community and the priests/Mass celebrants, the prayer for healing led by Kuya Mon was inserted at the latter part of the Mass celebration.  It was agreed then that those who took part in Kuya Mon's training may practice/apply what they have learned during the Prayer for Healing.

Two priests concelebrated the Mass. During the healing part, after Kuya Mon's talk/sharing, people who wanted to be prayed over were invited to come to the altar. One of the priests, an Augustinian who was just discharged from the hospital because of a quite fatal injury (he was still walking with a limp that time), requested to be prayed over first. The other priest (a Filipino) seconded, so he was prayed over too. The seminarian who then served as acolyte, came third. With this gesture of the priests and the acolyte, most, if not all, of those who attended the Mass, came to the altar to be prayed over.  This was the first time this ever happened in this church. Oh the awesome presence of the Lord manifested!!!  Testimonies of healing were noted, and those who helped in praying over (those who attended Kuya Mon's short training session) experienced too the boldness from the Holy Spirit to operate their gifts. Joy, love, peace – God's presence, seemed to have filled the air! 

Updates

1.	I received news from Dirk Claeys that as of date, CARA NOVA continues to conduct Healing Sessions in their community. They are thankful for the boldness they received from the Holy Spirit in operating the gifts they were given, and were certainly thankful to Kuya Mon for the his talk before the group, for inspiring them, and for initiating and paving the way for them to use their gifts.
2.	The MSN Community continued as well the Prayer for Healing as part of it's June Sto. Niño Mass celebration. It intends to make it now a regular part of all its Sto. Niño Mass celebrations, with not only the priest/celebrant praying over for healing, but also those committed members of the community who attended Kuya Mon's training. 

Hallelujah! All glory, honor and praises be to our ever faitful, living God!!! 

We believe that Kuya Mon's coming was right according to God's timing. The harvest is ready and doors seemed open. May we completely discern what HE has planned for the FOFJ to do. Like what we used to say, we have not seen anything yet. May HE continue to direct our path.
