	<pre style="font-size:150%">In his anniversary message last January 2007, Kuya Mon admonished the Community to seek and receive the faith to do greater things that the FOFJ has never done before and to go where the Community has never gone before. He also prayed that God would enlarge the capacity and ability of the FOFJ to do all things that God wants the Community to do in line with its missionary mandate to be a light to the nations, a community set ablaze to touch the world.

In April, YFJ student leaders from Iloilo and Cagayan de Oro traveled to Manila to participate in the first YFJ National Convention in Bulacan and to fellowship with their counterparts in Metro Manila. As part of their learning experience, they visited several FOFJ office ministries/local communities to participate in their prayer meetings and also to visit scenic spots/Iandmarks in Metro Manila.

The Community also held a National Convention in April that was attendedby the various FOFJ ministries and local communities. The convention aimed to rally the Community to achieve its goal to be on fire to touch the world in 2007. The convention had three modules focusing on worship, the professionals and marriage renewal. It was also the opportune time forthe Community to launch its first CD entitled "Pinagpala" featuring 20 songs that  were translated from English to Tagalog by Kuya Mon.

The Professional Group meanwhile, held a series of recollections to strengthen its members consisting of YFJ alumni who are now young professionals and members of FOFJ Center, TMG and office ministries.

The year 2007 was envisioned to be the defining moment of what  the FOFJ could really contribute to the Body of Christ. It was the year for the community to launch its international ministry ushered in by the fulfillment of the FOFJ dream to stage a Worship Celebration at the Araneta Coliseum held last December 2007. Thus from August to November 2007, monthly global gatherings were held in different venues to prepare the participants and the communities for the staging of this event.
