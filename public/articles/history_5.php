	<pre style="font-size:150%">In the nineties, FOFJ focused its efforts in strengthening its office ministries and making inroads to new harvest fields, namely, the youth and the school campuses, couples and their families, and street children.
	In May 1991, the FOFJ-South Community was established as one of the first off-springs of FOFJ. Its birthing stage started in 1988 when a group of FOFJ office ministries composed of PNB Buendia, National Investment and Development Corporation (NIDC), Security Bank, and the Department of Science and Technology(DOST) formed the Makati Federation which held its meetings and other activities at the DOST in Bicutan. At present, the SouthCommunity holds its regular Sunday prayer meetings in Las Pinas City.

	During the same year, the YoungFlames for Jesus (YFJ) was established.The FOFJ Youth Ministry was started in 1991 at the Polytechnic University of thePhilippines (PUP) in Sta. Mesa, Manila by Liza, Nap, Claro and Chat, four of the fulltime FOFJ missionaries after completing their mission work in Bolinao, Pangasinan.The Lord provided the opening for the FOFJ to evangelize the PUP campus through Fr. Ramon Salinas who was then the Archdiocesan Campus Director for the Archdiocese of Manila.

	After the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991 and the mass relocation of Aeta communities, the FOFJ started its outreach programs for Aetas in Pampanga and Zambales. The FOFJ conducted annual relief drives and gift-giving programs, and sponsored medical missions to several Aeta communities.

	Focusing its efforts on a new harvest field, the Marriage Renewal (MR) Ministry of FOFJ started in May 1996 when 14couples attended  a week-end seminar conducted by the Wedded Hearts for Jesus.The MR seminar aims to renew the couples'commitment and enhance their relationship to each other. During a span of ten years, several hundred couples attended the MR seminars conducted by the Wedded Hearts and the MR groups of the Center, South, Bulacan and San Mateo Communities. MR seminars are envisioned to bring more harvests of couples and families to the Lord because MR graduates are encouraged to open prayer groups in their communities and to undergo leadership and workers' trainings to boost their spiritual growth.
