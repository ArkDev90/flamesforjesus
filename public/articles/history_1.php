	<b><h1 style="font-size:180%" class="section-title">A Prayer Group in PNB</h2></b>
	<pre style="font-size:150%">God called Ramon Dela Cruz and Teresita Cruz (nee Santos) to start a prayer group in the Head Office of thePhilippine National Bank (PNB) in Escolta, Manila. They heeded God's call and started a Bible study group on January 12, 1977 which later became the PNB Christian Community. About 12-15 young men and women, fresh college graduates and new employees of PNB attended the daily noontime prayer meetings/fellowship, once a week after-office Bible studies in Luneta, and outreaches to institutions like the National Mental Hospital. After some time, the other members stopped attending the prayer meetings and eventually, Kuya Mon and Sis. Tess were the only ones left in the Community. However, they did not give up because they knew that it was God'splan for them to continue.

In due time, the Lord started bringing in new people into the Community, key people who would later play significant roles in His great plan and purpose for the Community. These key people together with Kuya Mon and Sis. Tess would eventually become the Elders of the Community.

The Lord also gave the Community a Spiritual Director, Fr. Fitzgerald from the nearby Sta. Cruz Church to provide spiritual guidance to the group.
