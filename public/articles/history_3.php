	<pre style="font-size:150%">As the PNB Christian Community grew in membership and affiliation, the Elders saw the need to change the name of the Community into the Flames of Fire forJesus (FOFJ) which was taken from Psalm104:4 and Hebrews 1:7 "He makes winds His messengers, flames of fire His servants."With these scriptural passages  as guideposts, the Elders crafted the FOFJ vision to be "The Light to the Nations" and dedicated the FOFJ to God as a missionary community.

To formalize its existence as a non-stock, non-profit corporation, the Flames of Fire forJesus was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1984. Its primary purpose is to establish and maintain an activity of worship and service to the Almighty God; to provide for a Christian fellowship; to share the privilege and responsibility of proclaiming and propagating the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ; to conduct and provide meetings for Bible studies, prayer meetings and seminars for Christian growth and assisting established Christian organizations; and to establish branches and extensive services in as many areas possible in the Philippines and abroad for the promotion of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

To enable the various prayer groupsto meet in one venue, the FOFJ established a Center where the monthly First Saturday Prayer and Fasting were held. The Center was first located in Talayan, then it was transferred to New York St. in Cubao and later at the Quezon City Catholic Charismatic Secretariat in Timog. At present, the FOFJ Center is located at Latukan, Manresa, Quezon City.
