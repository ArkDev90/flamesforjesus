	“There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens... He has made everything beautiful in its time...”  (Ecc. 3:1-11)

It was during our last visit to the Philippines in September/October 2017 when we reiterated  our invitation to some dear brothers and sisters in the FOFJ community to visit Belgium. As to when such visit shall happen, we simply said that – when it is God's time, HE shall reveal it to us.

And so it happened. Bro. Ramon's (Kuya Mon) availability to visit us was confirmed – his Schengen visa has been granted!

	The kick-off activity of this European breakthrough happened during the pilgrimage to Kevelaer, Germany. The activity was organized by the Ministry of Sto. Niño, Ghent, the community we are affiliated with here in Belgium. Even prior to the filing/approval of Kuya Mon's Schengen visa, we (I and my husband Carlos) already had our seats reserved for said pilgrimage. When I received the news that Kuya Mon's travel papers were already in process, I requested that another seat be reserved for us. However, around that time we were informed that all seats have already been reserved, but were promised that we will be immediately advised the moment somebody backs out. After a few days, the availability of the seat for him has been confirmed.  Kuya Mon arrived 2 days before the pilgrimage. The Lord ordained that he'll be part of the pilgrimage!

With the leaders/shepherds of the MSN community, and in coordination with the priest/Mass celebrant, the prayer for healing led by Kuya Mon was set, and it took place during the latter part of the Mass. Despite the limited time the MSN community was given by the church (the Basilica of St. Mary) wherein the Holy Mass was celebrated, the Lord's wondrous healing touch manifested – that many of those who were prayed over testified about experiencing the Lord's touch and healing. 

This event was actually made the prelude to the Healing Activity the following day in Sint Stefanus church in Ghent – an activity scheduled and organized likewise by MSN – to which Kuya Mon was also invited to be the speaker. This was in lieu of its regular Sunday Bible Meeting.
